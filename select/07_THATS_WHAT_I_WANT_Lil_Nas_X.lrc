[00:04.82] One, two, three, four
[00:15.32] 
[00:06.68] Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
[00:09.45] Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
[00:12.12] Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
[00:14.21] Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
[00:37.71] 
[00:17.33] An afro, black boy with the gold teeth
[00:20.29] With dark skin, looking at me like he know me
[00:23.07] I wonder if he got the G or the B
[00:25.35] Let me find out and see, coming over to me, yeah
[00:49.35] 
[00:28.34] These days, I'm way too lonely
[00:31.01] I'm missing out, I know
[00:33.95] These days, I'm way too alone
[00:36.40] And I'm known for giving love away, but
[00:55.90] 
[00:38.69] I want someone who love me
[00:43.86] I need someone who needs me
[00:49.68] 'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
[00:52.84] And it's just me in my dreams
[00:54.58] So I want someone to love, that's what I fucking want
[01:21.08] 
[01:02.22] Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
[01:06.75] But I got nothing but love on my mind (my mind)
[01:09.26] I need a baby with love in my prime
[01:11.91] Need an adversary to my "down to marry"
[01:31.41] 
[01:14.75] Like, tell me, "That's life" when I'm stressing at night
[01:16.95] Be like, "You'll be okay", and, "Everything's all right," uh
[01:20.03] Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
[01:22.58] But your loving, your body, and a little bit of your brain
[01:51.58] 
[01:25.34] These days, I'm way too lonely
[01:28.59] I'm missing out, I know
[01:31.02] These days, I'm way too alone
[01:33.74] And I'm known for giving love away, but
[01:53.24] 
[01:35.18] I want someone who love me
[01:40.85] I need someone who needs me
[01:46.43] 'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
[01:49.73] And it's just me in my dreams
[01:51.88] So I want someone to love, that's what I fucking want
[02:18.38] 
[01:58.75] I want (I) someone to love me
[02:04.25] I need (I) someone who needs me
[02:10.27] 'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
[02:13.02] And it's just me in my dreams
[02:15.42] So I want someone to love, that's what I fucking want
